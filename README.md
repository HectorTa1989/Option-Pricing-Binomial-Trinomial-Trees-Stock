# Binomial Option Pricing Algo (no dividends)
This program calculates an options price by using the Binomial Tree method. A series of inputs are taken and the tree is calculated in a feed forward way. The tree then calculates the spread between the Stock/Strike or Strike/Stock depending on the option price. The payoffs are discounted backwards through the tree (time based) and equate to the options price.
